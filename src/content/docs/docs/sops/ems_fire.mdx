   reasonable.
3. Coordinate with EMS prior to patient handoff.
4. Communication between Fire and EMS is required during complex scenes.

<Aside type="note" title="Coordination Matters">

## **EMS Medical Guidelines**

1. Ensure the scene is secured before treatment.
2. Conduct realistic patient assessments based on the incident.

   - No instant or unrealistic healing
   - Allow time for treatment roleplay
   - EMS does not participate in law enforcement actions

<Aside type="caution" title="Role Separation">
  Fire & EMS roles exist to provide medical and rescue support, not enforcement
  or investigative authority.
</Aside>

## **Refusal of Care**

1. Patients may refuse medical care with a valid roleplay reason.
2. EMS must acknowledge and roleplay the refusal.
3. Refusal does not override server rules regarding death or injury roleplay.

<Aside type="note" title="Roleplay First">
  Refusal of care should add to the roleplay, not bypass consequences.
</Aside>

---

## **Enforcement & Accountability**

1. Minor SOP issues should be handled through roleplay when possible.
2. Repeated or disruptive behavior may be addressed by staff.
3. SOP violations may result in removal of Fire or EMS privileges.

<Aside type="caution" title="Accountability">
  Fire & EMS roles are positions of trust and are held to a high standard.
