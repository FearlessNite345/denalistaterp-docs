### **Sonoran CAD – Unit Number Format**

When setting your **Unit Number** in Sonoran CAD, use the following format based on your department. This helps ensure proper unit identification by dispatch and other officers.

**Required Format:**  
`AREA | UNITNUMBER`  
*(Set this in the "Unit Number" field in CAD, as shown below)*

![Unit Number Example](../../../../assets/unit_number_format.png)

#### Approved Formats by Department:

- `SANDY | ###` – For **Sandy Shores Police Department (SSPD)**
- `METRO | ###` – For **Los Santos Police Department (LSPD)**
- `PALETO | ###` – For **Paleto Bay Police Department (PBPD)**
- `STATE | ###` – For **San Andreas State Troopers (SAST)**

> **Example:** `STATE | 276`  
> This would represent a State Trooper with unit number 276.

Please make sure you are using the correct format before going on duty.

#### **Guidelines:**

- **De-escalate** whenever possible using voice and presence.
- Always give **clear warnings** before using force.
- Do not escalate beyond what is **reasonable and necessary**.
- Lethal force should always be a **last resort**.

:::note
Always assess the situation carefully before deciding on the appropriate level of force.
:::

### **Disciplinary Actions**

1. Failure to follow rules will result in **LEO tag removal**.
2. You may reapply only after **one month** if tags are removed.
3. In severe cases, you may **not be allowed to regain your tag** if staff determines that you should not have it based on the reason it was removed.

:::warning
