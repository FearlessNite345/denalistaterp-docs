   Use department-approved uniforms and equipment only.  
   Make sure your character appears professional and fits department standards.

2. **Vehicle Use**  
   You may use any marked unit from your department’s motor pool.

   Plates must follow this format: **LEO  ###** with two spaces between the letters and numbers.

<Aside type="caution" title="Equipment Discipline">
Unauthorized or excessive use of weapons, vehicles, or equipment may result in disciplinary action or removal of your LEO tag.

## **Professional Conduct**

1. Do not exploit, metagame, or powergame in any situation.  
2. Treat all players, whether civilian or law enforcement, with respect.  
3. Escalate only when absolutely necessary; **force is a last resort**.  
4. Maintain in-character professionalism and avoid out-of-character remarks during active roleplay.

<Aside type="note" title="Conflict Resolution">
Always attempt to resolve situations through communication first.  
Escalation should occur only when verbal compliance fails or safety becomes a concern.
</Aside>

## **Radio and Communication Protocol**

1. Use proper **10-codes** and keep transmissions short and clear.  
2. Limit radio traffic to essential information.  
3. During high-priority or **Signal 100** calls, only transmit critical messages.  
4. Identify yourself using your **unit number and department** when transmitting.

<Aside type="note" title="Signal Codes">
**Signal 100** – Hold all but emergency traffic  
**Signal 60** – Drugs  
**Signal 11** – Running radar  
**Code Zero** – Game crash  
**Code 4** – Under control  
**Code 5** – Felony stop or high-risk stop

<Aside type="caution" title="Miscommunication Risk">
Incorrect or unclear radio communication can result in confusion, delays, or unsafe outcomes during active incidents.
</Aside>

## **Use of Force Guidelines**

Officers must use the **least amount of force necessary** to safely control a situation.  
Your response should always remain **one level above** the suspect’s actions and proportionate to the threat.

| **Suspect Behavior** | **LEO Response** | **Examples / Notes** |
|---|---|---|
| **Compliant** | Verbal Commands | Clear instructions, no physical force |
| **Passive Resistance**<br/>(ignores commands, walks away) | Soft Hands or Physical Guidance | Escort by arm, basic control holds |
| **Active Resistance**<br/>(running, struggling) | Taser or OC Spray | Use if verbal commands fail |
| **Aggressive or Assaultive**<br/>(punching, kicking) | Baton or Less-Lethal Shotgun | Only if actively violent |
| **Threat with Weapon (non-firearm)** | Draw Firearm but Hold Fire | Maintain distance, issue clear commands |
| **Lethal Threat**<br/>(firearm aimed, vehicle used as weapon) | Lethal Force Authorized | Must be a direct threat to life |

<Aside type="caution" title="Key Principles">
Always attempt to de-escalate when possible.  
Provide clear warnings before using force whenever it is safe to do so.  
Lethal force should always be the final option.
</Aside>

## **Response Codes**

<Aside type="tip" title="Code 1 / 2 / 3 Usage">
**Code 1** – Routine response, obey all traffic laws.  
**Code 2** – Urgent response without lights or sirens unless needed.  
**Code 3** – Emergency response with lights and sirens active.
</Aside>

## **Traffic Stops and Pursuits**

<Aside type="tip" title="Traffic Stop Flow">
1. Call out **10-11** with plate, location, occupant count, and reason for stop.  
2. Position your vehicle for safety and cover.  
3. Approach carefully, greet the driver, and explain the reason for the stop.  
4. Run **10-27**, **10-28**, and **10-29** as needed.  
5. Conclude by issuing a warning, citation, or arrest, then call **Code 4** when the scene is clear.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger" title="Pursuit Protocol (10-80)">
Primary unit calls direction of travel, speed, vehicle description, and traffic conditions.  
Request air support or spike strips as allowed.  
Supervisor approval (**10-71**) is required to continue a pursuit.  
Terminate when the risk to public safety outweighs the need for apprehension.  
Announce **Code 4** when the pursuit ends.
