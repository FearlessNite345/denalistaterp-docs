## Welcome to DSRP

By joining **Denali State Roleplay**, you’re entering an immersive, mature community driven by storytelling, fairness, and respect. These terms are simple: follow them, or you’ll be removed. No second chances for rulebreakers.

If this isn’t for you — no hard feelings. This isn’t your average server.

---

## Entry Requirements

To be part of DSRP, you must:

- Be **18+** — no exceptions.
- Speak and understand **English** fluently.
- Use a **clear microphone** — bad audio kills immersion.
- Wear **headphones** — echo and feedback ruin scenes.
- Have accessibility needs? **Mute/deaf players are welcome.**  
  Our **ASL script** by **cDev** is available.

---

## Roleplay Guidelines

We do serious RP. That means:

- **Stay in character.** Take OOC to OOC Channels.
- **Respect the scene.** Don’t powergame or metagame.
- **No RDM or VDM.** Every action must be justified IC.
- Follow our **full RP rulebook** (linked in the docs).

---

## Server Rules

- **Follow all DSRP rules and staff instructions.**
- **Harassment, racism, and hate speech = immediate ban.**
- **No exploits, cheating, or glitch abuse.**
- **Illegal RP stays legal OOC.** No real-world crimes or actions.

---

## Enforcement and Appeals

- **Break the rules? You’ll face consequences.**  
  That could mean a warning, kick, suspension, or permanent ban.
- **Staff decisions are final.**  
  Think it was unfair? Use the appeal form — not DMs.
- Repeated or severe violations = **non-negotiable removal**.
