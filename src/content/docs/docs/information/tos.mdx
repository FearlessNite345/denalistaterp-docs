## Welcome to DSRP

By joining **Denali State Roleplay**, you are entering an immersive and mature community built on storytelling, fairness, and respect.  
These terms are simple: follow them, and you will remain part of the community. Consequences depend on the severity of the situation, but repeated or serious violations can result in removal at the discretion of the Staff Team.

If this is not the right environment for you, there are no hard feelings. Denali State Roleplay is not your average server, and it is meant for those who value quality, creativity, and respect in every interaction.

## Entry Requirements

To be part of DSRP, you must:

- Be **18+**, with no exceptions  
- Speak and understand **English** fluently  
- Use a **clear microphone**, since poor audio breaks immersion  
- Wear **headphones**, as echo and feedback ruin scenes  
- Have accessibility needs? **Mute and deaf players are welcome**  
  Our **ASL script** by **cDev** is available

<Aside type="tip" title="Accessibility Support">
Players who use accessibility tools or alternative communication methods are fully welcome. Contact staff if you need setup assistance.

## Roleplay Guidelines

We do serious roleplay. That means:

- **Stay in character** and keep OOC talk in OOC channels  
- **Respect every scene** and avoid powergaming or metagaming  
- **No RDM or VDM**, every action must be justified in character  
- Follow the **full RP rulebook** linked in the documentation

<Aside type="caution" title="Stay Immersed">
Breaking immersion or going out of character during active scenes may result in removal from the situation or a staff-issued warning.
</Aside>

---

## Server Rules

- **Follow all DSRP rules and staff instructions**  
- **Harassment, racism, or hate speech means an immediate ban**  
- **No exploits, cheating, or glitch abuse**  
- **Illegal RP stays legal out of character**, no real-world crimes or actions are ever acceptable

<Aside type="danger" title="Zero Tolerance">
Any form of hate speech, discrimination, or malicious intent results in an immediate and permanent ban without review.
</Aside>

---

## Enforcement and Appeals

Disciplinary actions are taken seriously within DSRP.  
Staff decisions are considered final and are **rarely overturned**. In most cases, **appeals are not permitted**.

Only in exceptional circumstances, such as clear staff error or a verified misunderstanding, may an appeal be reviewed by the **Staff Team**.  
These cases are extremely limited and handled internally.

<Aside type="note" title="Accountability">
If your removal was issued for clear rule violations, the decision is final. Attempting to evade bans or create new accounts will result in permanent exclusion from all DSRP services.
</Aside>

## Our Content and Creations

- All **scripts, textures, and assets** belong to their creators  
- **No redistribution, resale, or unauthorized edits**  
- If you wish to use something, always ask first

<Aside type="tip" title="Respect Creative Work">
Everything in DSRP exists because of creators’ time and effort.  
Never copy, leak, or modify content without explicit permission.

- Stream overlays and in-character content

- Fan art or social media posts that represent the server positively  

### Unacceptable Uses
Branding must **never** be used for:
- Paid merchandise, NFTs, or any commercial purpose  
- Misleading or impersonating accounts, servers, or creators  
- Projects that misrepresent, parody, or damage DSRP’s reputation  

For **official use**, written permission must be obtained from **Joshua L.**  
You may contact via **Discord: `thefearlessstudios`** for authorization or brand-related questions.
