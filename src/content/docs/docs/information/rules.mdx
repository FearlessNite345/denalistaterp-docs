## Community Interaction

### Fair Play & Favoritism

- Favoritism or behavior that creates a negative or exclusionary environment is not permitted.
- Group roleplay and friendships are allowed, but they must not be used to isolate, target, or discourage others from participating.
- DSRP is built around inclusive roleplay. Everyone should feel welcome to roleplay with anyone, regardless of status or group size.
- If you have an issue with another player, bring it to staff’s attention so it can be handled fairly.

<Aside type="note" title="Staff Neutrality">
Staff are expected to remain neutral and fair at all times. If you feel a situation is being handled with bias, you may ping **404 | Joshua L.** directly.
</Aside>

### Staff Engagement

- Do not spam or harass staff. Use tickets for support requests.
- Only ping staff in emergencies (e.g., griefing, major disruptions).
