# **Civilian Information**

<Aside type="note" title="Getting Started">

As a civilian, your main goal is to create **realistic, story-driven RP** within Denali State Roleplay.  
Your character choices, vehicles, and interactions should reflect believable, grounded behavior.  
Play smart, stay immersed, and focus on building your story — not just chasing chaos or money.

</Aside>

## **Menus & Commands**

<Aside type="tip" title="Vehicle Menu (F9)">

Press **F9** to open the **Vehicle Menu**.  
From here, you can view **all vehicles currently available** for civilian use.

You **are allowed** to use the “OP Options” within the menu, but only **within reason**.  
For example:
- ✅ Showing off a unique build or tuning for car shows or creative RP.  
- ❌ Using power options to constantly flee police or drive 200+ MPH through the city.

If used irresponsibly, staff will step in and handle it appropriately.

<Aside type="note" title="In-Game CAD / MDT Access">

Use the **/tablet** command to open the **in-game CAD/MDT**.  
From there you can:
- Manage or register your vehicles  
- View your licenses  
- Update or create new characters  
- Access civilian reports and information

Keeping your info accurate helps law enforcement and staff verify your RP quickly and keeps everything running smoothly.

## **Roleplay Expectations**

<Aside type="caution" title="Stay In Character — Always">

You **must stay in character at all times** while connected to the server.  
**Do not use /ooc, or any similar out-of-character chat** while in-game.  
If you need to contact staff, **do not use in-game chat** — use our **Discord ticket system** instead.  

Examples:
- ✅ *“/me tries to start the car again after it stalls.”*  
- ❌ *“/ooc Didn’t happen in my eyes.”* — not allowed.  

If you need to step away while interacting with others, find a **believable in-character excuse** so players understand what’s happening without breaking immersion — for example:  
> “Oh, I just remembered I have a meeting I need to get to.”

> “I’ve got somewhere to be, I’ll catch up with you later.”  

Keep it natural and make sure others know your character is leaving the scene temporarily.  
Scenes can always be continued once you’re back.

<Aside type="tip" title="Civilian Conduct">

- Treat every RP situation like it’s real life.  
- Avoid random violence, baiting LEOs, or unrealistic crime.  
- Respect all emergency services and staff directions.  
- Do not powergame (forcing outcomes) or metagame (using info your character wouldn’t know).  
- Remember: the goal is **immersive, believable stories**, not constant chaos.

## **Enforcement**

<Aside type="danger" title="Community Standards & Enforcement">

Our staff team is dedicated to maintaining a fair, immersive, and enjoyable environment for everyone.  
If behavior or actions disrupt that balance, we will review the situation and respond appropriately.  

All staff matters are handled **exclusively through the Discord ticket system**, not in-game.  
We encourage players to reach out respectfully and work with staff to resolve any issues or concerns.
