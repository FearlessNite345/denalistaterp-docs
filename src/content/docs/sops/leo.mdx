| **Suspect Behavior**                                                 | **LEO Response**                                      | **Examples / Notes**                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compliant**                                                        | Verbal Commands                                       | Clear instructions, no force needed                       |
| **Passive Resistance**<br />(e.g., ignoring commands, walking away)  | Soft Hands / Physical Guidance                        | Escort by arm, basic control holds                        |
| **Active Resistance**<br />(e.g., running, struggling)               | Taser / OC Spray                                      | Use if verbal commands fail or suspect resists physically |
| **Aggressive / Assaultive**<br />(e.g., punching, kicking)           | Taser / Baton / Less-Lethal Shotgun                   | Only if actively violent, avoid unnecessary escalation    |
| **Threat with Weapon (Non-Firearm)**                                 | Firearm Drawn (Do Not Fire Unless Threat Is Imminent) | Maintain distance, give loud commands                     |
| **Lethal Threat**<br />(e.g., firearm aimed, vehicle used as weapon) | Lethal Force Authorized                               | Must be a direct threat to life of officer or others      |
