# Reason for wLauncher
Our fleet of emergency vehicles requires a specialized siren configuration tool within the FRP platform. **wLauncher** serves as a critical tool to efficiently handle this plugin integration process.

## Obtaining wLauncher
Secure the most recent version of **wLauncher** by visiting:

## Identifying the FiveM Executable
Upon initiating `wLauncher` for the first time, you will need to locate your `FiveM.exe`. This procedure involves identifying the FiveM installation path on your system for proper initialization and plugin application.

**Common Installation Directory**  
```plaintext
%localappdata%\FiveM
```

### Profile Integration Steps:
<Steps>

2. Open **wLauncher** on your computer. 
3. Navigate to the option labeled "New Profile" 
4. Select "Import Profile" from the available options. 
5. Locate and select the downloaded file you obtained from Discord. After selection, the import process is complete!
</Steps>

With successful integration, you're prepared to engage with FRP seamlessly!

## Precautionary Measures

<Aside type="caution">
Some antivirus solutions might incorrectly categorize `wLauncher.exe` as malicious. This is a false alarm, and you'll need to tailor your antivirus settings to permit **wLauncher** installation.

Additionally, certain web browsers might block the download of wLauncher, mistaking it for an insecure file. If this occurs, you'll have to manually allow the download to proceed by overriding the browser's security warning.

For those seeking reassurance regarding the software's integrity, check the detailed VirusTotal report:
