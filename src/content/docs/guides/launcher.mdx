## Purpose of wLauncher
To operate effectively within FRP, our emergency vehicles rely on a specific siren configuration limit adjuster. To streamline this process, we utilize **wLauncher** to effectively manage this plugin integration.

## Acquiring the Launcher
You can obtain the latest edition of **wLauncher** by visiting:

## Locating the FiveM Executable
After launching `wLauncher` application for the first time, you'll be prompted to locate and select `FiveM.exe`. This step involves finding the installation path of FiveM on your system so that the launcher can appropriately initialize FiveM and apply our necessary plugins.

**Typical Installation Path**  
```plaintext
%localappdata%\FiveM
```

<Aside type="tip">
Enter the above path into your file explorer’s address bar to quickly navigate to the FiveM directory.

## Profile File Setup
To seamlessly connect to our server, you'll need a specific profile file which is accessible via our Discord channel. Please download this file and import it into **wLauncher** for proper setup.
