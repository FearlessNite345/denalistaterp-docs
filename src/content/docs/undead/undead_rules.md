## **Welcome to Fearless Undead!**

Our aim is to offer a **realistic, immersive, and balanced** roleplaying adventure. Although we maintain a minimal rule set, these guidelines are essential to uphold the exceptional standards of our community. **By participating in Fearless Undead, you consent to adhere to these rules.**

## **General Rules**

These rules apply to all members and are designed to keep the community fun and immersive for everyone.

### **1. Safe Zone Guidelines**

- **No PvP Combat:** Engaging in player versus player killing is strictly **prohibited** within safe zones. These areas are designated as **SAFE** havens and must be respected as such.
- **Zombie Presence:** While zombies may occasionally wander into safe zones, they tend to exit swiftly, maintaining the area's security

### **2. Death and Looting**

- **Upon Death:**
  - You will lose all possessions except for your bag.
  - Respawn at an unpredictable location, ready to face new challenges.
- **PvP Dynamics:**
  - You're free to eliminate others and claim their belongings.
  - Engage in robberies by holding players at gunpoint, giving them the chance to drop their loot in exchange for survival.
- **Survival Priority:**
  - Staying alive is paramount, given the significant consequences and setbacks associated with death.\*\*

### **3. Player vs. Player (PvP) Guidelines**

- **Interact Before Engaging:** In this zombie survival world, consider talking to others, forming alliances, and building friendships before resorting to violence. Collaboration can be as strategic as combat.
- **Survival Rules:** Random Deathmatch (RDM) and Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM) are allowed, reflecting the unpredictable and dangerous nature of the environment.
- **Accept the Consequences:** If youâ€™re killed and looted by another player, embrace it as part of the survival experience. Use these encounters to adapt and strengthen your gameplay.
